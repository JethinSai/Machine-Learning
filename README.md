In this assignment, we learned the distinctions between sets (), lists [] and tuples, how to create and use them, and how to refer to the elements of a set, list, or tuple. 
We also used a variety of functions, including print, sort to order numbers in ascending order, append to add an element to the end of a list, len to count the number of elements in a list and set, 
and sum to calculate the sum of the numbers in a set in and how to establish a dictionary and remove words from it using the del function. more features like. 
To join two sets, use the union function, split function to split the elements, learned some other basic logics and functions of python.

In This assignmet, we learn by creating a random 1-dimensional array of size 15 with integer values ranging from 1 to 20. It then reshapes this array into a 3x5 matrix. The maximum element in each row is replaced by 0 using NumPy's "where" function.
Next, a 2-dimensional array of size 4x3 is created with integer elements, and its shape, type, and data type are printed.
Then, the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a given matrix are computed using NumPy's "eig" function.
After that, the sum of the diagonal elements of a given 2-dimensional array is computed using NumPy's "trace" function.
Finally, a pie chart is created using Matplotlib library to show the popularity of various programming languages.
