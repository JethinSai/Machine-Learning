In this assignment, we learned the distinctions between sets (), lists [] and tuples, how to create and use them, and how to refer to the elements of a set, list, or tuple. 
We also used a variety of functions, including print, sort to order numbers in ascending order, append to add an element to the end of a list, len to count the number of elements in a list and set, 
and sum to calculate the sum of the numbers in a set in and how to establish a dictionary and remove words from it using the del function. more features like. 
To join two sets, use the union function, split function to split the elements, learned some other basic logics and functions of python.

In This assignmet, we learn by creating a random 1-dimensional array of size 15 with integer values ranging from 1 to 20. It then reshapes this array into a 3x5 matrix. The maximum element in each row is replaced by 0 using NumPy's "where" function.
Next, a 2-dimensional array of size 4x3 is created with integer elements, and its shape, type, and data type are printed.
Then, the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a given matrix are computed using NumPy's "eig" function.
After that, the sum of the diagonal elements of a given 2-dimensional array is computed using NumPy's "trace" function.
Finally, a pie chart is created using Matplotlib library to show the popularity of various programming languages.

In This assignmet, we learn by creatininvolves implementing various programming elements using the pandas and scikit-learn libraries. The first part involves working with a provided CSV file, where the student must perform basic statistical analysis, check for null values and replace them with the mean, and aggregate data using various functions. The second part involves working with two different datasets (Titanic and Glass) and implementing Na√Øve Bayes and linear SVM methods using scikit-learn, as well as visualizing correlations within the datasets. The student must also report on the accuracy of each method and justify which algorithm achieved better accuracy.

In this assinment we learn about segmentation using the K-Means algorithm. The data is first loaded from a CSV file using pandas. The data is preprocessed by removing unnecessary columns and handling null values by replacing them with the mean value of the corresponding column. PCA is then used to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and K-Means clustering is applied to the PCA-transformed data. The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters, and the silhouette score is calculated to evaluate the quality of the clustering. Finally, feature scaling is applied using the StandardScaler method, and PCA is applied again to the scaled data. K-Means clustering is once again applied to the PCA-transformed data, and the elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
